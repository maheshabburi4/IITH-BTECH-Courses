Taking inputs: For each program, as input, you can take three things from the users: the number of elements in the array, the array itself, and the search key. Please use maximum three print statements to prompt the user enter these inputs. Do not have separate print statements to enter the individual elements of the array (e.g. do not print statements like "enter the 1st element", "enter the 2nd element" etc.)
