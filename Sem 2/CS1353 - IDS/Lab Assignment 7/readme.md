Create a singly linked list with a sequence of positive integers input from console/terminals. The order of the elements in the list should be same as the order of the elements coming as the input. When a negative integer appears in the console, you can consider the input to be terminated.

After the input is terminated, find the following by looking at the linked list:
(a) The smallest element from the linked list.
(b) The first element from the list that is strictly greater than the mean of the elements present in the linked list

You have to write a separate function each for the above tasks.
