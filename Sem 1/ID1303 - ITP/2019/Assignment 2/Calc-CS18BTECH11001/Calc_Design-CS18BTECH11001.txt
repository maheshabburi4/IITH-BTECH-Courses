1.We have declared the first input with char data type as it stores the given symbols using ASCII characters.
2.On giving 2nd and 3rd inputs more than 10^9 the int data type can't store it then the solution will be bad.
3.As the multiplication of two integer numbers can be of range 10^18 and as the integer cant be used to store this value we have used long data type.
4.Any operation of two integers will be stored as an integer.To convert them to required datatype we use typecasting to atleast one operand of required datatype.
Eg: (long)a+b - will convert a from integer to long data type for which the result will be of long datatype.
5.As the division value is to be store the decimal numbers too and as int data type can only store the integers we have used double(high precision) data type.
6.we know that any number divided by 0 results infinity we are checking this case before performing division and outputting Error.
7.I used %.10g because it eliminates all the 0's preceding after the last non-zero number in the double value upto 10 decimal values.
