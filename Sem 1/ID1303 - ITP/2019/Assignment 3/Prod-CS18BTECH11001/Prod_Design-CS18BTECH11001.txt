1.I stored the input value in a variable of int datatype and declared a long variable for storing the product.
2.I am checking whether N>1(as positive even numbers start with 2) and N<=30(else the product will be out of range of long datatype as already given)
3.I declared an integer j to store the even numbers obtained while iterating.initialised j=2 as 2 is the smallest even number.As even numbers differs by 2 i have added 2 to j in every iteration and checking whether j<=N ar not.if it is not satisfied the loop will be exited.printing j will print the integer number associated with that iteration.so while the loop ends all the required prime numbers will be printed.
4.Multipling product with the new even number obtained by adding 2 to j until the loop ends give the product of the even numbers <=N.after the loop ends we will print the final product is obtained.
5.The else if case includes N=1(as there is no even positive integer less than or equal to 1 i will keep the output blank.)
6.The else cases includes N<1(give that N must be a positive integer,so invalid input,so we print "Error"),N>30(product will be greater than 10^18.As the variable declared to store product is of long datatype which cant store value greater than 10^18,it is an Integer overflow and invalid case.So we print "Error" as given).
