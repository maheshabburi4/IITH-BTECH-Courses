
1.I first taken the input from the user by declaring two variable of int type as given <=15.
2.I checked whether the given input satisfies the given conditions using a if condition
	i)x>=y		- else the combination is invalid
	ii)y>=0 or x>=0	- else the combination will be invalid
3.if the above conditions satisfied then i declared a long variable for combination value
4.I have created a long returing function(since the value may be large and can't be stored in int data type) for the factorial which has arguments of an integer.
5.I have declared a long variable for factorial value and initialised to 1.
6.I have used a for loop which iterates from 2 to n and mutiplies the iteration value to the long variable.
7.if n<2(n=1 or n=0 since we have already checked the input value conditions that they and their differance are non-negative) then it results 1 as previously we have initialised the long variable to 1.
8.Finally i have returned the factorial value.
9.Now i performed the operations for finding the combination value using the formula.
10.Finally i printed the combination value.

pseudo code:
fact :
for(i from 2 to n)
	res=res*i
ret res
.main :
if x>=y
	comb=fact(x)/fact(y)*fact(x-y)
	print comb
