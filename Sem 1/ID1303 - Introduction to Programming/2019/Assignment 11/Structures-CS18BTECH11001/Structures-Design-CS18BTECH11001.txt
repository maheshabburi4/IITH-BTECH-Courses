Pseudo code:

struct engine:
	string serial,material
	int dd,mm,yyyy,weight

wgt5(*part,N):
	print Serial no >5
	for i from 0 to N
		if part->weight >5
			print part->serial
			flag=1
		part++
	if flag=0
		print No values found

year_btw(*part,N):
	print Year of manufacture b/w AA2 & BB7
	for i from 0 to N
		k=part->serial[2]-'0'
		c=part->serial[0]
		if (c=='A' and k>1) or (c=='B' and k<8)
			print part->yyyy
			flag=1
		part++
	if flag=0
		print No values found

detail_3_years(*part,N):
	print engine within 3 years
	for i from 0 to N
		diff=15-part->dd+(11-part->mm)*30+(2019-part->yyyy)*30*12
		if diff is between -1080 and 1080
			flag =1
			print part->serial,part->dd,part_ptr->mm,part_ptr->yyyy,part-ptr->material
			do until part_ptr->weight is between 1 & 10
				input part_ptr->weight
		part++
	if flag=0
		print No values found

main():
	input N
	for i from 0 to N
		part_ptr=&part[i]
		input part_ptr->serial,part_ptr->dd,part_ptr->mm,part_ptr->yyyy,part-ptr->material,part_ptr->weight
	wgt5(part,N)
	year_btw(part,N)
	details_3_years(part,N)

Design:
1.declared a structure with name engine which contains a string for serial,3 ints for date,month,year ,a string for material,a int for weight
2.taken No of parts(N) from user and declared a structure array of size N and a structure pointer
3.take inputs from user by passing address of each element in the array to pointer.used a do while loop for weight which runs unti lthe user enter weights in between  1 and 10
4.called a function wt_5(weight greater than 5) for checking the structures which have weight greater than 5,year_btw( for checking which year products are having serial number between AA2 and BB7),details_3_years(for checking which parts are manufactured within 3 years of 15th Nov 2019) by passing the array as pointer and N as parameters.
5.In the wt_5 function I used for loop from 1 to N and check whether the part->weight value is greater than 5 or not.if yes I change the value of flag to 1 and print the serial value of corresponding pointer.after each iteration i increased the value of structure pointer which then points to the next element in the array.At the end I check whether fla g is 0 or not.if yes I print That No elements are found.
6.In the year_btw function I used a for loop from 0 to N and checked if the first character of serial of coressponding pointer is 'A' and 3rd number(type casted from char to int) is greater than 1 or is 'B' and 3rd number is less than 8,I print the year corresponding pointer and chnge the value of flag to 1.After Each iteration I increase the value of structure pointer which then points to the next element in the array.At the end I check whether fla g is 0 or not.if yes I print That No elements are found.
7.In the details_3_years function i used a for loop from 0 to N and calculate the difference between the date of coressponding pointer and 15th Nov 2019 making an assumption that each month contains 30 days,each year contains 12 months in total.i checked if the difference is within 3 years(3*30*12=1080) in both ways 2016-2019,2019-2022.if yes,I printed all the details coresponding to the pointer and changed the flag to 1 and increased the pointer.At the end I checked if the flag value is 0 or not.if yes I print No values found.

Assumptions:
1.The serial value is of 3 characters and the first two characters are in upper case and same.
2.all the dates entered is of dd-mm-yyyy and valid.
3.The max characters of material is 5.
4.All the pointers to the function are not NULL(i.e., N!=0)
