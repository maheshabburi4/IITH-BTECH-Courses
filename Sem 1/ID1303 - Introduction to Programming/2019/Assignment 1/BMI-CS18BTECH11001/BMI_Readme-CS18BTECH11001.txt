Compile & Run:
1.I named the code with BMI-CS18BTECH11001.c. 
2.Opened Terminal.
3.I used the following command to compile the code
	gcc -o prog BMI-CS18BTECH11001.c
  here I named the file created after compiling as "prog"(any arbitary name).
4.I used the following command to run the code

  We run the code using the file formed by compiling.
